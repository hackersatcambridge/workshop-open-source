Contributing to open source is fun, useful and is an excellent way to get your name out there. And the best thing is that it's not that hard at all! Contributing to open source projects can be easy and painless, but it can be a bit intimidating to get started.

This workshop will bring you up to speed on everything you need to know to get started making your own contributions to your favourite projects, with a live step-by-step demonstration of making a contribution from scratch.

We'll cover: how to find an issue to start with, setting the project up, implementing the change and making a pull request to share your change with the world.
